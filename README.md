Project 2(Using LLM, VectorDB, Stream Lit)
Information Retrieval System project is an example of building a practical RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application. Here's a summary of what I've accomplished and learned:
Document Processing: Implemented PDF parsing and text extraction using PyPDF2, learning how to handle multiple documents and error cases.
Text Processing: Learned about chunking strategies using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to break down documents into manageable pieces.
Vector Embeddings: Worked with Google's AI models to convert text into vector embeddings, gaining knowledge about semantic search concepts.
Vector Databases: Utilized FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to store and efficiently query vector embeddings.
LLM Integration: Connected with Google's Generative AI models (moving from PaLM to Gemini) to generate contextual responses.
Conversation Management: Implemented conversation history tracking and memory components.
Web Application Development: Built a user-friendly interface with Streamlit, complete with file uploading, processing indicators, and conversation display.
Environment Management: Learned about managing Python environments with Conda and handling package dependencies.
API Management: Incorporated Google API authentication and environment variable management using dotenv.
